      Entity is the root class of ‘core’ classes model - those that have identifiers and other general 
      metadata like labels, xrefs, urls, descriptions, etc. All core classes descend from and inherit 
      its attributes.

          The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is 
          unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different

      ValueEntity is the root class for classes that instantiate Value Objects. ValueEntity classes
      are not extensible and MUST NOT have optional properties.
